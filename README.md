Welcome to my **Frontend Practice Lab**!  
This repository is a collection of my HTML and CSS practice work where I focus on improving my frontend development skills.

The main purpose of this repo is to build reusable UI templates, explore different design ideas, and improve my coding style through practice and experimentation.

## ðŸš€ What's included
- ðŸ§¾ HTML & CSS practice files  
- ðŸ§© Mini projects and micro layouts  
- ðŸŽ¨ UI components (buttons, cards, navigation, etc.)
